Hi! I'm David. I'm a machine learning engineer and applied ML scientist. My interests include computer vision, generative AI, and deep learning in biotech. I am a big fan of mentorship and servant leadership. Some non-professional things I love include traveling to far-flung places with my bike and trying to set high scores on pinball machines :)
