**My professional bio:**

I am a data scientist and ML engineer with experience at large and small companies covering software, biotech, and utilities. Before working in industry I received my PhD in neuroscience where I published papers on computational neuroimaging. A summary of my industry experience: 1) I designed and built real-time ML apps for Intuit's QuickBooks, improving the product experience for over a million users. 2) led some cool projects at a biotech startup predicting neurological disease using computer vision, analytics, and ML. 3) Most recently I have been working as a technical lead in the utilities space, helping teams of data scientists and engineers to implement predictive maintenance using machine learning and computer vision.

**More broadly:**

My professional interests focus on scientific applications of machine learning, especially involving computer vision and generative AI. I am a big believer in servant leadership and mentorship, and I do both actively. I also am generally interested in topics at the intersection of science, AI, data, and epistemology. You can read a few of my own original thoughts in the blog here.

**Some hobbies:**

I love skiing, traveling to far-flung places with my bike, and trying to set high scores on pinball machines :)
